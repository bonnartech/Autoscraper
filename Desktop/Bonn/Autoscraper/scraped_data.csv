p,"The painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape.

The three-quarter view, in which the sitter’s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century. The subject’s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo’s skillful handling ofsfumato(use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo’s studied observations and inexhaustible patience. Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter’s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her. The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting—especially apparent in the sitter’s faint smile—reflects Leonardo’s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo’s vision.

Yet this simple description of a seemingly standardcompositiongives little sense of Leonardo’s achievement. The three-quarter view, in which the sitter’s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century. The subject’s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo’s skillful handling ofsfumato(use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo’s studied observations and inexhaustible patience. Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter’s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.

That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographerGiorgio Vasari. Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo’s mother, Caterina. That interpretation was put forth by, among others,Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa’s mysterious smile emerged from a—perhaps unconscious—memory of Caterina’s smile. A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo’s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter’s and the artist’s facial features. Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist’s riddle. The sitter’s identity has not been definitively proven.

Moreover, theLouvre Museumwould probably never sell it. The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for theMona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment. Indeed, the museum considers theMona Lisairreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.Why is the Mona Lisa so famous?Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece’s celebrity, including itstheftfrom theLouvrein 1911 and its tour to the U.S. in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation.

It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living inFlorence, and it now hangs in theLouvre Museum,Paris, where it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century. The sitter’s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.SubjectUnraveling the mystery behind theMona LisaOverview of Leonardo da Vinci'sMona Lisa, with a discussion of the sitter's identity.(more)See all videos for this articleThe painting presents a woman in half-body portrait, which has as a backdrop a distant landscape. Yet this simple description of a seemingly standardcompositiongives little sense of Leonardo’s achievement. The three-quarter view, in which the sitter’s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century. The subject’s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo’s skillful handling ofsfumato(use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo’s studied observations and inexhaustible patience. Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter’s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her. The sense of overall harmony achieved in the painting—especially apparent in the sitter’s faint smile—reflects Leonardo’s idea of the cosmic link connecting humanity and nature, making this painting an enduring record of Leonardo’s vision.

Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (née Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence thealternativetitle to the work,La Gioconda. That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographerGiorgio Vasari. Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo’s mother, Caterina. That interpretation was put forth by, among others,Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa’s mysterious smile emerged from a—perhaps unconscious—memory of Caterina’s smile. A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo’s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter’s and the artist’s facial features. Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist’s riddle. The sitter’s identity has not been definitively proven. Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo’s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.HistoryLeonardo da Vinci began painting theMona Lisaabout 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519. He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times.

For centuries the portrait was secluded in French palaces, until insurgents claimed the royal collection as the property of the people during theFrench Revolution(1787–99). Following a period hanging inNapoleon’s bedroom, theMona Lisawas installed in theLouvre Museumat the turn of the 19th century.In 1911 the painting was stolen, causing an immediate media sensation. People flocked to the Louvre to view the empty space where the painting had once hung, the museum’s director of paintings resigned, and the poetGuillaume Apollinaireand artistPablo Picassowere even arrested as suspects. Two years later an art dealer inFlorencealerted local authorities that a man had tried to sell him the painting. Police found the portrait stashed in the false bottom of a trunk belonging toVincenzo Peruggia, an Italian immigrant who had briefly worked at the Louvre fitting glass on a selection of paintings, including theMona Lisa. He and possibly two other workers had hidden in a closet overnight, taken the portrait from the wall the morning of August 21, 1911, and run off withoutsuspicion. Peruggia was arrested, tried, and imprisoned, while theMona Lisatook a tour of Italy before making its triumphant return to France.DuringWorld War IItheMona Lisa, singled out as the most-endangered artwork in the Louvre, was evacuated to various locations in France’s countryside, returning to the museum in 1945 after peace had been declared.

Scholars and historians have posited numerous interpretations, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (née Gherardini), the wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, hence thealternativetitle to the work,La Gioconda. That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographerGiorgio Vasari. Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo’s mother, Caterina. That interpretation was put forth by, among others,Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa’s mysterious smile emerged from a—perhaps unconscious—memory of Caterina’s smile. A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo’s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter’s and the artist’s facial features. Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist’s riddle. The sitter’s identity has not been definitively proven. Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo’s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.HistoryLeonardo da Vinci began painting theMona Lisaabout 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.

Yet this simple description of a seemingly standardcompositiongives little sense of Leonardo’s achievement. The three-quarter view, in which the sitter’s position mostly turns toward the viewer, broke from the standard profile pose used in Italian art and quickly became the convention for all portraits, one used well into the 21st century. The subject’s softly sculptural face shows Leonardo’s skillful handling ofsfumato(use of fine shading) and reveals his understanding of the musculature and the skull beneath the skin. The delicately painted veil, the finely wrought tresses, and the careful rendering of folded fabric demonstrate Leonardo’s studied observations and inexhaustible patience. Moreover, the sensuous curves of the sitter’s hair and clothing are echoed in the shapes of the valleys and rivers behind her.

That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographerGiorgio Vasari. Another theory was that the model may have been Leonardo’s mother, Caterina. That interpretation was put forth by, among others,Sigmund Freud, who seemed to think that the Mona Lisa’s mysterious smile emerged from a—perhaps unconscious—memory of Caterina’s smile. A third suggestion was that the painting was, in fact, Leonardo’s self-portrait, given the resemblance between the sitter’s and the artist’s facial features. Some scholars suggested that disguising himself as a woman was the artist’s riddle. The sitter’s identity has not been definitively proven. Numerous attempts in the 21st century to settle the debate by seeking Lisa del Giocondo’s remains to test her DNA and recreate an image of her face were inconclusive.HistoryLeonardo da Vinci began painting theMona Lisaabout 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519.

div,"Top QuestionsWho was the Mona Lisa in real life?There has been much speculation and debate regarding the identity of theMona Lisa’s sitter. Scholars and historians have posited numerous possibilities, including that she is Lisa del Giocondo (née Gherardini), wife of the Florentine merchant Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo—hence the alternative title to the work,La Gioconda. That identity was first suggested in 1550 by artist biographerGiorgio Vasari.How many years did it take to paint the Mona Lisa?Leonardo da Vincibegan painting theMona Lisain 1503, and it was in his studio when he died in 1519. He likely worked on it intermittently over several years, adding multiple layers of thin oil glazes at different times. Small cracks in the paint, called craquelure, appear throughout the whole piece, but they are finer on the hands, where the thinner glazes correspond to Leonardo’s late period.Where is the real Mona Lisa kept?TheMona Lisahangs behind bulletproof glass in a gallery of theLouvre MuseuminParis, where it has been a part of the museum’s collection since 1804. It was part of the royal collection before becoming the property of the French people during theRevolution(1787–99).What is the value of the Mona Lisa?TheMona Lisais priceless. Any speculative price (some say over a billion dollars!) would probably be so high that not one person would be able or willing to purchase and maintain the painting. Moreover, theLouvre Museumwould probably never sell it. The museum attracts millions of visitors each year, most of whom come for theMona Lisa, so a steady stream of revenue may be more lucrative in the long run than a single payment. Indeed, the museum considers theMona Lisairreplaceable and thus spends its resources on preventive measures to maintain the portrait rather than on expensive insurance that can only offer mere money as a replacement.Why is the Mona Lisa so famous?Many theories have attempted to pinpoint one reason for the art piece’s celebrity, including itstheftfrom theLouvrein 1911 and its tour to the U.S. in 1963, but the most compelling arguments insist that there is no one explanation. TheMona Lisa’s fame is the result of many chance circumstances combined with the painting’s inherent appeal.Learn more.",Positive
